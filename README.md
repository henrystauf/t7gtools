This repo is legacy! In efforts to be more organized, two new repos have been created. Please use the following links to access the new repos:

# v64tng

This is the new project that `t7gtools` morphed into. It is a complete rewrite of the original codebase from scratch, and is written in C++.

# The-7th-Guest-Toolset

This repo contains 2023 refactorings of the Deniz Oezman Object Pascal code from the early 2000s that will compile on every single platform using Lazarus or just `fpc` directly by following my documentation. The original code can be found here: [oezmen.eu](https://oezmen.eu/)
